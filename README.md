occlusion is the function of occlusion method, referenced from Rieke et al., 2018
compute_occlusionmap is to compute the subject-level occlusion maps and group-level occlusion maps
output_ROIs is to out put the ROIs of Glo-CNN based on heatmap (group-level occlusion map)
brain_region.txt is the numbers and names of brain regions
seg_in_template_space.nii.gz is the segmentation result of brain regions on template
The template of brain image is too large so it haven't uploaded to the repository
